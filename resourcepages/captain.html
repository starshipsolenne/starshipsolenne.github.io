								<h3>Biography</h3>
								<p>
									Captain Ariella Fawnbrook currently serves as the commanding officer of the USS Solenne, a Justiciar-Class Command Cruiser operating under the authority of Starfleet Strategic Command. Born in 2394, she entered Starfleet Academy at age 18, graduating with dual concentrations in xenomedicine and ethical command studies. Commissioned as a medical officer in 2416, she served with distinction aboard the USS Altamira and later the USS Caelestis, where her exemplary performance during high-casualty relief missions and first contact support operations marked her early as a capable leader under pressure.<br><br>
									While serving as Chief Medical Officer during the Kharthan Bio-Crisis (2419), Fawnbrook successfully contained an emergent neural contagion aboard an overcrowded refugee transport, earning her the Starfleet Medal of Commendation for crisis containment and medical innovation under extreme triage conditions.<br><br>
									In 2421, during the Tayvora IV Evacuation, she assumed temporary command of the USS Caelestis following the incapacitation of the senior bridge staff. Coordinating both evacuation and ship defense, she successfully extracted over 300 Federation civilians from an unstable tectonic region while maintaining orbital integrity under atmospheric strain. Her actions earned her a Field Promotion to Lieutenant Commander and the Grankite Order of Tactics (Merit Class).<br><br>
									Fawnbrook formally transferred to the command division in 2422, attending Advanced Command School at Starbase 11. Her subsequent appointment to the USS Solenne in 2424 marked one of the youngest command appointments in recent Starfleet history for a vessel of its class. She has since overseen multiple classified diplomatic convoys and joint Starfleet–Caitian Defense Force operations along the Kzin border.<br><br>
									Captain Fawnbrook is known throughout the Fleet for her calm demeanor, medical precision, and diplomatic sensitivity, particularly in volatile frontier sectors. As both a former healer and now a commanding officer, she embodies Starfleet’s ethos: to explore with courage, lead with compassion, and defend peace through integrity and resolve.<br><br>
									Known for her composure in crisis, strategic acuity, and unwavering commitment to Federation principles, Captain Fawnbrook exemplifies the ideals of Starfleet leadership. Her tenure has been marked by operational excellence, diplomatic innovation, and strong advocacy for the inclusion of underrepresented species and cultures within the Fleet. She has overseen the Solenne’s transition into a multi-mission command platform, balancing tactical readiness with scientific inquiry and diplomatic outreach.<br>
									Captain Fawnbrook continues to uphold Starfleet’s highest standards of integrity, compassion, and courage as she leads her crew in exploration, peacekeeping, and defense of the United Federation of Planets.
